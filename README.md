# Neon Sign with Cat Detection

# Introduction
* This is primarily used when my cat enters her litter box or sits on the litter box, a neon sign with "on air" lights up.
* Achieved using the distance difference between 0.25 seconds. If either sensor detects distance value change, the sign lights up.
* If distance values no longer change, the light will continue to be on for 5 seconds before it turns off.

# Parts Needed
* In the schematics, the neon sign is expressed as a red LED light for simplicity.
